## Overview
Successfully analyzed the freeradiantbunny Rust project and performed comprehensive git repository cleanup by consolidating multiple branches into a single main branch, removing stale development branches, and updating the default branch configuration.

## Work Completed
- Invoked applications-developer agent to analyze freeradiantbunny project structure and status
- Verified that site_configuration.rs file issue mentioned in CLAUDE.md was already resolved
- Identified three git branches (main, master, daisy) and their divergence history
- Confirmed main branch was 8 commits ahead of master branch
- Deleted remote daisy branch via `git push origin --delete daisy`
- Changed repository default branch from master to main (performed via GitHub web settings)
- Deleted remote master branch (performed via GitHub web interface)
- Updated local remote HEAD to point to main via `git remote set-head origin --auto`
- Verified final repository state with single main branch

## Files Changed
- No source code files were modified during this session
- Repository configuration changed (default branch, remote tracking)

## Key Decisions
- Consolidated multiple branches into single main branch as the authoritative development branch
- Removed stale master and daisy branches to simplify repository structure
- Set main as the default branch for all future clones and work
- Maintained full commit history by not performing destructive rebase or squash operations

## Issues Resolved
- Multiple branch confusion resolved: Previously had active main branch alongside stale master and obsolete daisy branches
- Default branch mismatch resolved: Repository default was master, but active development occurred on main
- Remote HEAD tracking corrected: Local tracking updated to reflect new main default

## Pending Items
- None identified. Repository cleanup complete and ready for production use.

## Notes for Next Session
- Repository structure is now clean with single main branch
- Main branch is set as the default for all operations
- All development should occur on main branch going forward
- No further branch consolidation needed
- Site configuration file (src/freeradiantbunny/site_configuration/site_configuration.rs) exists and is properly configured
- GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/lplinden/freeradiantbunny
- Local project path: /home/mudiabot/webapps/freeradiantbunny
- Project is a Rust-based web framework for permaculture designers with PostgreSQL backend
