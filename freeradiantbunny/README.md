freeradiantbunny

freeradiantbunny is a database-backed website designed as a plant list system with an herb garden information system for permaculture design method freaks on top and in fact the system may doubles as an multimedia inquiring system aiming to make the herb garden maps a delightful and edcucational experience.

Our mascot is Kitto, the botany bunny, and is said to be an expert on all things Radiant Bunny if only he could be asked about it before hopping quickly away.
