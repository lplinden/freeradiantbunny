freeradiantbunny

freeradiantbunny is a database-backed website designed as a plant list system with an herb garden information system for permaculture design method freaks and in fact the system may double as an multimedia inquiring system aiming to make the herb garden maps a delightful and educational experience.

Our mascot is Kitto, the botany bunny, and is said to be an expert on all things gardening and Radiant Bunny and so on if only he could be asked about it before hopping quickly away.
